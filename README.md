## Authentication / Authorization
eCommerceshop offers a robust authentication system that enables users to conveniently and securely access the platform through their Google and Facebook accounts. Additionally, for users who choose to log in using their email addresses, an email containing a verification link will be sent to ensure the authenticity of their account.

Our platform employs **role-based access control for authorization**, which involves categorizing permissions into roles such as "User" or "Admin" and then assigning these roles to respective users. This practice is a widely recognized and effective method for organizing authorization mechanisms.

The **authentication process** is further enhanced with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Access, Refresh Tokens, Cookies, and Axios integration. In cases where a request, such as a "getCourse" request, results in a 401 error due to unauthorized access, a RefreshToken API is invoked.

Upon receiving a response from the RefreshToken API, the original request is reattempted, thus enabling a seamless continuation of the user's intended action.

Should the Refresh Token expire, a 'Refresh Token Invalid' message will be presented with a 403 HTTP status code, indicating that the user needs to reauthenticate.

In situations where a 403 error occurs during the RefreshToken API process, a user-friendly notification in the form of a "sweet alert" will be displayed for 5 seconds. Subsequently, all local storage will be cleared, and the window will be reloaded for a complete sign-out effect. This ensures that users are aware of the situation and provided with a smooth logout experience.

## Admin Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard is a powerful tool that allows administrators to manage various aspects of the platform. Admins can control categories, products, brands, sizes, and more. They can also view order history, sales analytics, and manage featured products.

## User Interface
The user interface is designed to provide customers with an intuitive shopping experience. Users can browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The interface also supports advanced search and filter options for efficient product discovery.

## Categories
Categories in eCommerceshop can be organized hierarchically, allowing for nested categories. Administrators can create, update, and delete categories. Each category can be designated as a leaf or a tree, enhancing flexibility in categorization.

## Products
Product management includes the ability to create, update, and delete products. Administrators can also mark products as "featured," which will showcase them on the homepage for increased visibility.

## Brands
eCommerceshop allows administrators to manage brands, enabling users to filter products by brand. Brands can be created, updated, and deleted to provide a comprehensive catalog.

## Sizes
Sizes are an integral part of the product catalog. Administrators can define available sizes for products, facilitating accurate ordering by customers.

## Image Management
The integration with Cloudinary enables efficient image management for products. Multiple images can be uploaded for each product, and administrators can easily update or delete images as needed.

## Search and Filters
eCommerceshop offers advanced search and filter options for categories, products, sizes, and price ranges. Pagination ensures that results are manageable and user-friendly.

## Orders and Sales
Users can view their order history and delete any order,  and administrators have access to sales analytics. Graphs display best-selling products and revenue overviews on a weekly basis.
